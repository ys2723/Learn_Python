# Readline function

Modes of opening a file: 

r = open for reading
w = open for writing
a = open for appending      (helps in adding text)
+ = open for updating         ('+' does the work of both 'r' and 'w')

'rb' will open for read in binary mode.
'rt' will open for read in text mode. ('t' is by default)

# W

f = open('sample.txt', 'w') 
f.write('This line is added to the file') 
f.close()

g = open('another.txt', 'a')
g.write('Appending') 
#this line will keep getting added the number of times we hit 'run'
g.close()

# With statement

with open('file.txt', 'r') as c:
    c.read() 
# no need to write close here because w
